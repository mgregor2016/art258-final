            <h2>About the Untelevised Revolution</h2>
            <p>Specifically 'Untelevised Revolution" references Gil Scott Heron's audio recording/poem "The Revolution Will Not Be Televised" which was introduced to me by my wise Aunt in the summer of 2011.  My understanding of the purpose of his message was to harken those who were asleep to awake and to those who were unaware to become aware - aware of what was and is still going on in the world. The revolution won't be televised because revolution is not a televised or a schedule event. Sure media, news outlets and historians can attempt to capture and recapture the traces and events that lead to a revolution but the best way to see what is going on in a revolution is to get involved in one.</p>
            <p> My take on revolution is that its something that starts with the individutal.</p>
            <p>During my last visit with my Aunt Elaine in the summer of 2011, there seem to be an unusual amount of unrest across the Western World. In San Francisco there were protests over slaying of an unarmed man by the Bart Police. There were demonstrations across the US deploring the rise of the 1% at the cost of the 99%. And in Europe there were a number of manifestations over the austerity measures being put in place in various countries due lagging economies. </p>
            <p>There are so many travesties and injustices in the world, that ignoring the problems will not make make them go away. But wallowing in them without some action also won't serve us well.</p>
            <p>This site is inspired by information, a need to create and to activate a dialogue that needs to had about the state of the world and progress that needs to take place.</p>
            <p>Another purpose of this site is to remember our collective roots. It's also meant to serve as an outlet for the dismay that comes with being aware, truly aware of whats going on this planet.</p>
            <p>Because its important to find some sanity in all this chaos, I tried to insure that a healthy amount of wisdom, guiding light and optimism also touch these pages.</p>
